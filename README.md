# PwnScripts

The original intention that I build this Repository is a few days ago I saw the https://github.com/matrix1001/welpwn, which is designed to make pwnning an art. So I decided to write something to make my pwnning more artistic.

## pwn.sh

Usage:

move pwn.sh to the PATH

```
pwn.sh [filename] ([ip]) ([port]) ([libcname])
```

When I start a new pwn, I always copy an old script and change the filename, libcname, ip and port one by one. This is so meaningless.

The framework of the pwn script is welpwn. It is so easy to 
specify libc for the program.
